            <h3 class="h2">What we aim to achieve</h3>
            <p>For our clients, we aim to generate as many leads as we can, with very minimal input from the client. We can help clients generate leads by distributing their listings/products to other major portals, ensuring that they get the right exposure! Which will in turn result in increased lead generation.

            <h3 class="h2">New Markets</h3>
            <p>It's one thing for you to get your listings seen in your own country, but quite another to get them seen by overseas buyers. In the current economic climate, it is increasingly important to attract buyers from other countries. However, the websites and portals that serve one country are often not very visible in another. So, to be seen by international buyers, for example, the listings need to be published on the portals most visible in those territories.
